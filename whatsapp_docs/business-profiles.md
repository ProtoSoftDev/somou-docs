# Business profiles



Your business phone number&#039;s profile displays additional information such as address, website, and description. You can add this information when registering your phone number or update the profile later via WhatsApp Manager or the API.

## View or update your profile in WhatsApp Manager

To view or update your business profile via WhatsApp Manager:

1. Navigate to [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/) &gt; **Account tools** &gt; **Phone numbers**.
2. Select your business phone number.
3. Click the **Profile** tab to view your current profile.
4. Use the form to set new profile values.

## Get your profile via the API

Before you call the API, make sure you have a business phone number ID and a [system user access token](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/access-tokens) with the [required permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/permissions).

Use the [WhatsApp Business Profile API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/reference/whatsapp-business-phone-number/whatsapp-business-profile-api#get-version-phone-number-id-whatsapp-business-profile) to get specific business profile fields:

### Field notes

- The `vertical` field can be updated via POST. The `WhatsAppVertical` enum defines the valid values (excluding `UNDEFINED` and `NOT_A_BIZ`). You can also change this value using [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/).
- The `address` field accepts freeform text (maximum 256 characters) and does not validate against any geographic database.
