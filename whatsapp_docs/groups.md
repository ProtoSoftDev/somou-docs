# Groups API


**Success:** **Eligibility for Groups API**

The Groups API is now open to all businesses with an [Official Business Account (OBA)](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/official-business-accounts).

The Groups API enables you to programmatically create groups for messaging and collaboration.

## How it works

Groups are an invite-only experience where participants join using a group invite link you send them. This invite link provides context about the group, helping the user decide whether they want to join.

## Get started

When you are ready to start using the Groups API, see the Get started guide for more information:
