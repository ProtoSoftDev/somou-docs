Create Multi-Partner Solution

Create a new Multi-Partner Solution that defines permission distribution between
a solution owner app and a partner app for WhatsApp Business messaging collaboration.


**Permission Logic:**
- Only one partner (owner or partner app) can have MESSAGING permission
- At least one partner must have MESSAGING permission
- Both partners automatically receive default solution partner permissions
- Empty permission arrays indicate no configurable permissions for that partner


**Solution Lifecycle:**
- Solutions are created with INITIATED status
- Require subsequent activation workflow through solution management
- Can be managed through Partner Dashboard or solution management APIs


**Rate Limiting:**
Standard Graph API rate limits apply with WhatsApp Business Management throttling.
Use appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff for rate-limited requests.


**Validation:**
- Partner app must be accessible and have proper capabilities
- Permission combinations are validated against business logic rules
- Solution names must meet length and content requirements
