# How to use Multi-Solution Conversations (MSC)


## Overview

Multi-Solution Conversations allows businesses to use multiple partners and solutions **on the same phone number**, creating a seamless chat thread experience for their customers.

## Requirements

- This feature is currently in a closed beta. Please reach out to your partner manager for more details.
- Your business portfolio must have an [increased messaging limit](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messaging-limits#increasing-your-limit).
- Businesses with banned or restricted WhatsApp Business accounts (WABA) are not eligible. Use the [Business Support Home](https://business.facebook.com/business-support-home/) to address restrictions.

## Features

- **Simple end-business onboarding via Embedded Sign-up:** Partners can onboard businesses easily through [Embedded Signup](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/solution-providers/multi-solution-conversations#onboarding-for-msc--embedded-signup-flow-).
- **Payment and template isolation per partner:** Each partner has their own WhatsApp Business Account, their own templates, and their own billing and metrics.

## Limitations

Since this feature is still in beta, some functionality may not work as expected. See [Beta Product Testing Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/BetaProductTestingTerms).


## How Multi-Solution Conversations work

The chart above illustrates a new WABA shared with each integrated partner, and assets separated per WABA.

1. Your client shares all phone numbers associated with their WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) to you through the [Embedded Signup flow](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/solution-providers/multi-solution-conversations#onboarding-for-msc--embedded-signup-flow-).
1. The system creates and shares a new WABA with you.
1. You now have messaging or calling access to the business phone numbers shared with you and can message or manage calls on behalf of your client.

### Supported APIs and usage

Businesses can use a single phone number across one or multiple partners across the following APIs and uses:

* [Messaging via WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/messages/send-messages)
* [Calling via WhatsApp Cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/calling)
* [Click-to-WhatsApp Ads via Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/447934475640650?id=371525583593535)

## Additional limitations

**MSC does not currently support:**

* Conversation routing and management: currently, all parties the phone number is shared with receive incoming webhooks. Businesses must work with partners to manage response handling.
* WhatsApp Business app phone numbers
* Phone numbers using the Groups API
* WABA created through Embedded Signup which are used on Ads Manager for Marketing Messages
* [Measurement Partner onboarding](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/solution-providers/measurement-partners)

### General limitations

- Only 5 partners or solutions can be enabled per each end-business WhatsApp Business Account (WABA).
- Only 1 partner can attach a catalog to the shared phone number(s) between partners.

### Phone number sharing limitations

Your client cannot share a phone number with the same partner more than once via different WABAs.

For example, your client has a phone number linked to WABA 1 and then shares WABA 1 with Partner 1. If you have the same phone number linked to WABA 2, you cannot also share WABA 2 with Partner 1. If you try to share the phone number, you may receive an error.

## Onboarding for MSC (Embedded Signup flow)

**Warning:** 

Once a business meets the eligibility requirements, the MSC flow for Embedded Signup is automatically displayed in the Embedded Signup flow ([v2 and above](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/versions#version-2)). Partners don&#039;t need to configure anything in Embedded Signup for this to work.

When businesses sign up to a partner through Embedded Signup, they see the flow below and can choose to share their existing business phone numbers. This onboards them to MSC. Embedded Signup has two experiences, and a given business may see either one randomly. Both experiences are described below.

**Once your client completes the Embedded Signup flow, you do not need to re-register with your client.**

### Embedded Signup flow for businesses (experience 1)

The **Notes** column calls out any MSC-specific notes for each screen.

| Screen | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| [Authentication screen](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/default-flow#authentication-screen) | No changes |
| [Authorization screen](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/default-flow#authorization-screen) | No changes |
| [Business Asset Selection Screen](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/default-flow#business-asset-creation-screen) | Here, you can select a WhatsApp Business account that is already shared with other partner(s). |
| [Phone number addition screen](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/default-flow#phone-number-addition-screen) | Select &#039;Use a new or existing WhatsApp number&#039;, then click on the dropdown &#039;Add a new WhatsApp number&#039;, then select existing WhatsApp Business Account you want to share with current partner. |
| [Permissions review screen](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/default-flow#permissions-review-screen) | No changes |
| [Success screen](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/embedded-signup/default-flow#success-screen) | No changes |

### Embedded Signup flow for businesses (experience 2)

Businesses onboard to MSC by using the Embedded Signup flow. Note that these screenshots may differ as the product evolves.

Step 1: Select the business portfolio.

Step 2: Select **Share existing WhatsApp phone numbers**.

Step 3: Your client selects the WABA with the phone number(s) they would like to share. Note that these numbers are only selectable if they have not been shared already with this partner.

Step 4: Create a name for the new WhatsApp Business Account being created.

Step 5: Verify permission information.

Step 6: Verify signup information and finish.

## Troubleshooting

**The &quot;Share existing WhatsApp phone numbers&quot; option is greyed out**

This can happen for several reasons:

1. Your client already has a solution with the partner they are trying to share the number with.
1. Your client has exceeded the 5 partner maximum for the number.
1. The phone number is not eligible to send 1k messages yet.
1. The phone number has not been registered.

**What can I do if the business phone number goes offline?**

Rarely, a phone number can go offline. To solve this issue, try the following:

1. Register the phone number again: Your client should search each of their WABA activity logs to find which partner registered the phone number first. Then, that partner can register the phone number again.
1. Turn off 2-factor authentication (optional): If your client cannot obtain which partner originally registered the phone number, they can shut off two-factor authentication and have another partner register the number again.
